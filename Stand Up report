# project-one
FCA takin over for the 99

What have you been working on? - we have been finishing up our individual tasks for the project.
What do you plan to work on between now and in next class? Next class we will spend all the time combining everything into a presentation
Any blockers, issues, question? Seem to be ok currently 
Also, how do you feel about your progress so far? Pretty good i think the process of combining them all will be interesting and may have some difficulties.
